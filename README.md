## üß† 1. Language, Symbolism & Future Philosophy

### ‚ó¶ Cognitive Linguistics & Metalanguage  
Language is not merely a tool for communication, but a kind of **container and generator of thought**.  
It shapes cognition, encodes identity, and constructs reality.

### ‚ó¶ Semiotics & Mechanisms of Desire  
From **Peirce** to **Lacan** and **Deleuze**, explore how language connects **power, identity, and impulse**.

### ‚ó¶ Modern / Postmodern / Future Philosophy  
From **Descartes** to **Wittgenstein**, **Foucault**, **Harari**, **Luhmann** ‚Äî how thought, power, and technology shape being.

### ‚ó¶ Mathematical Logic & Abstract Modeling  
Treat **metalanguage as the ultimate modeling syntax**. Explore how **set theory**, **category theory**, **formal systems**, **Turing-completeness**, and **G√∂del‚Äôs incompleteness** model consciousness.

### ‚ó¶ Computational Language & Meta-Reality Programming  
From **natural semantics** to **compiler theory**, study how code becomes the **infrastructure of technical reality**.

## üß¨ 2. Consciousness, Neural Mechanisms & General Intelligence

### ‚ó¶ Neuroscience & Artificial Consciousness  
Explore the link between **neural activity** and **subjective experience**, and how it informs models of **synthetic awareness**.

### ‚ó¶ Modern Psychology & Behavioral Systems  
Analyze cognitive structures, decision-making, unconscious processes, and **computational models of behavior**.

### ‚ó¶ Artificial & General Intelligence  
Explore **generalization limits**, **simulated awareness**, **ethics**, and **human‚ÄìAI coexistence**.

### ‚ó¶ Computational Autonomy & Tech-Liberty  
Advocate for **free software**, **individual sovereignty**, and systems enabling **informational self-governance**.

## üé® 3. Sensory Arts & Cultural Aesthetics

### ‚ó¶ Sexual Aesthetics & Embodied Culture  
Sex is a **biocultural interface**. Investigate how **desire, identity, symbol, and embodiment** converge into aesthetic expression.

### ‚ó¶ Music & Spatial Acoustics  
Explore how **rhythm, frequency, and reverb** shape emotion and perception through space.

### ‚ó¶ Olfactory Art & Experimental Perfumery  
Create **temporal-scent landscapes** by blending **molecular design**, **cultural narrative**, and **olfactory memory**.

### ‚ó¶ Visual Arts & Painting  
Study how **shape, color, composition, and imagery** activate perception; visual language as emotional code.

### ‚ó¶ Sculpture & Spatial Form  
Sculpture becomes an **extension of bodily intelligence**, integrating **material, proportion, and tactile logic**.

### ‚ó¶ Game Art & Immersive Aesthetics  
Design multisensory **virtual environments**, merging **interaction logic** and **aesthetic systems**.

### ‚ó¶ Sensory Interfaces & Multimodal Expression  
Unify **sight, sound, smell, and touch** to create embodied, **technologically enhanced art experiences**.

## üî¨ 4. Natural Science, Engineering & Materials

### ‚ó¶ Theoretical Physics & Mathematics  
Training includes **field theory**, **symmetry breaking**, **chaotic systems**, **topology**, **information theory**, etc.

### ‚ó¶ New Materials & Aesthetic Function  
Materials as **sensory mediums** ‚Äî light, heat, texture ‚Äî used in **design, architecture, and interaction**.

### ‚ó¶ Chemistry, Molecular Systems & Psychopharmacology  
Study how molecules affect **emotion, cognition, scent**, and **neural regulation**.

### ‚ó¶ Ecology & Evolutionary Adaptation  
Bridge ecological behavior with **techno-biological feedback** and **adaptive systems**.

### ‚ó¶ Structural Engineering & Distributed Complexity  
Model **form stability**, **modularity**, and **fractal structures** found in both **natural and artificial systems**.

## üñ•Ô∏è 5. Systems, Cybersecurity & Tech-Liberty

### ‚ó¶ System Architecture & Low-Level Computation  
Understand **OS design**, **compiler chains**, and **browser engines** as foundations of system autonomy.

### ‚ó¶ Hardware & Embedded Systems  
From **transistor logic** to **bus design**, link **physical computing** with **abstract logic systems**.

### ‚ó¶ Electronics & Circuit Design  
From **analog/digital signal flow** to **microcontroller interfaces** and **IoT systems**.

### ‚ó¶ Cybersecurity & Offensive-Defensive Structures  
Analyze **vulnerabilities**, **encryption protocols**, **penetration logic**, and **cybernetic defense**.

### ‚ó¶ Privacy & Informational Sovereignty  
Promote **encryption**, **decentralization**, and **personal data control** as digital survival fundamentals.

### ‚ó¶ Cyber Libertarianism  
Advocate for **freedom of expression, creation, anonymity, and choice** in the digital realm.  
Oppose centralization and disciplinary regimes; use **technology as a tool of liberation**.
