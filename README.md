## ðŸ§  1. Language, Symbols, and Future Philosophy

- **Cognitive Linguistics and Metalanguage**  
  Language is not just a tool for communication but a container and generative mechanism for thought. This explores how language maps cognition, encodes identity, shapes perception, and constructs worlds.

- **Semiotics and the Mechanics of Desire**  
  From Peirce to Lacan and Deleuze, how language links power, identity, and impulse.

- **Modern / Postmodern / Future Philosophy**  
  From Descartes to Wittgenstein, Foucault, Harari, Luhmann, and others, investigating how thought shapes existence.

- **Mathematical Logic and Abstract Modeling**  
  Using metalanguage as the ultimate form of mathematicsâ€”exploring set theory, category theory, formal systems, Turing completeness, and incompleteness theorems as tools for modeling consciousness.

- **Computational Language and Metareality Programming**  
  Bridging natural and formal languages, from semantics to compiler theory, exploring how computational language constructs the "metareality" of the technical world.

## ðŸ§¬ 2. Consciousness, Neural Mechanisms, and AGI Models

- **Neuroscience and Artificial Consciousness**  
  Exploring the correlation between neural activity and subjective experience, constructing technical models for simulated consciousness.

- **Modern Psychology and Behavioral Sciences**  
  Investigating the computable structures behind cognition, decision conflict, desire patterns, and the unconscious.

- **Artificial Intelligence and Artificial General Intelligence**  
  Reflecting on model generalization, boundaries of consciousness simulation, technological ethics, and possibilities for human-machine coexistence.

- **Computational Systems and Technological Autonomy**  
  Upholding software libertarianism, building system architectures that support individual sovereignty and information autonomy.

## ðŸŽ¨ 3. Sensory Arts and Aesthetic Culture

- **Sexual Aesthetics and Cultural Perception**  
  Sex is not only a biological act but a cultural mechanism. It is approached as a multimodal aesthetic interfaceâ€”psychologically, physiologically, socially, and artisticallyâ€”studying how sex becomes a convergence point of body, symbol, desire, and art.

- **Music and Spatial Acoustics**  
  Analyzing how rhythmic structures manipulate perception and cognition through tempo, frequency, and spatial reverberation as a psychological response system.

- **Olfaction and the Art of Perfumery**  
  Treating scent as an information interface, combining molecular design, olfactory memory, and cultural narratives to construct a temporal and metaphorical landscape of smell.

- **Visual Art, Painting, and Imagery**  
  Investigating how shape, color, composition, and imagery evoke perception. Using painting as a visual language to connect art history, constructivist psychology, and contemporary expression.

- **Sculpture and Spatial Form Design**  
  Exploring interaction between materials, proportions, and tactile sensation. Sculpture as an extension of bodily experienceâ€”merging form language, spatial perception, and material logic.

- **Immersive Games and Virtual Aesthetic Mechanisms**  
  From aesthetic systems to interaction logicâ€”integrating visuals, sound, narrative, and mechanics to study how virtual space and participatory art construct perception.

- **Sensory Art and Somatic Interfaces**  
  Integrating touch, sight, smell, and sound to design multimodal aesthetic experiencesâ€”exploring the body's role as a medium in technological aesthetics.

## ðŸ”¬ 4. Theoretical Natural Sciences, Natural Engineering, and Materials

- **Theoretical Physics and Mathematics**  
  Systematic training in field theory, symmetry breaking, chaotic systems, information theory, statistics, topology, and more.

- **New Materials Science and Aesthetic Practice**  
  Studying materials as sensory media by their tactile, thermal, and spectral propertiesâ€”merging utility and aesthetic form.

- **Chemistry, Drug Synthesis, and Molecular Systems**  
  Exploring molecular construction, neuromodulatory substances, and synthetic mechanisms that regulate cognition and emotionâ€”linking scent, mental states, and molecules.

- **Ecosystems and Evolutionary Adaptivity**  
  Integrating ecological behavior, biofeedback mechanisms, and technological interventionâ€”building "techno-ecological coupling systems."

- **Structural Engineering and Distributed Complexity**  
  Modeling structural form evolutionâ€”simulating natural stability, adaptivity, and fractal harmonics.

## ðŸ’» 5. Network Systems, Cybersecurity Structures, and Technological Freedom

- **System Architecture and Low-Level Languages**  
  Understanding the role of operating systems, browser engines, and compilers in systemic coherence and efficiency.

- **Computer Hardware and Embedded Architecture**  
  From transistors to bus designâ€”merging physical systems with abstract logic.

- **Circuit Logic and Electronic Systems**  
  From analog/digital signals to microcontrollers and IoT systemsâ€”designing real-world interfaces.

- **Cybersecurity and Offensive-Defensive Engineering**  
  Understanding system vulnerabilities, encryption protocols, penetration paths, and cyberspace game theoryâ€”building defensive freedom at the technical frontier.

- **Anonymity Rights and Information Freedom**  
  Emphasizing the foundational importance of privacy sovereignty, encrypted communication, decentralization, and personal data control in digital survival.

- **Cyber Libertarianism**  
  Affirming that technology should support individual freedom of choice, expression, creation, and anonymity. Advocating distributed power structures and opposing centralized control and technical disciplineâ€”using technology as a tool for liberty.
